## Advanced Bayesian Modeling
+ These projects explore practical methods and models for Bayesian data analysis. The major topics include prior selection, posterior inference tools, hierarchical models, methods of Bayesian computation, model
evaluation, and ordinary and generalized regression models.
+ The projects use R and JAGS for Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation.
